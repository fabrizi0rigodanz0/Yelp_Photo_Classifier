### Yelp Photo Classifier
This project focuses on developing a sophisticated computer vision system to classify business photos from Yelp into four distinct categories: Food, Drink, Interior, and Exterior. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the project explores various approaches to build and optimize a high-performance image classification model.

### Key Features and Techniques:
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to understand the dataset, including visualizing images and cleaning data.
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**: Implementation of a deep neural network with 20 hidden layers, using the ReLU activation function and Adam optimization, trained over 100 epochs to establish a baseline performance.
- **Overfitting Reduction**: Application of techniques such as weight regularization, batch normalization, dropout, and early stopping to mitigate overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Construction of a CNN architecture with multiple Conv2D layers and MaxPooling layers, optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilization of pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, and Inception from the ImageNet dataset. The transfer learning approach involves fine-tuning these models to adapt them to the specific task of classifying Yelp business photos.

### Objectives:
- Build and optimize a computer vision model capable of accurately classifying business photos.
- Compare the performance of different model architectures, including DNN, CNN, and transfer learning techniques.
- Demonstrate the application of advanced deep learning methods to improve model accuracy and robustness.

### Results:
- The project showcases the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in computer vision tasks, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy through model tuning and the use of transfer learning.
